;; Test case: Module that imports types and uses them in fields
;; Tests that imported type names are correctly resolved to qualified C names

(module import-b
  (import import-a (Foo Token))
  (export Bar Container)

  ;; Bar has a field of imported type Foo
  ;; The C code should use import_a_Foo, not import_b_Foo
  (type Bar (record (my-foo Foo)))

  ;; Container has a generic List of imported type Token
  ;; The C code should generate slop_list_import_a_Token, not slop_list_import_b_Token
  (type Container (record (tokens (List Token))))
